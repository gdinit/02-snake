// MISSING ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-Only activate main menu buttons if the window is active!

// KNOWN ISSUES ----------------------------------------------------------------
-CREDITS screen is missing. Main menu button is a shortcut to "PLAY (START GAME)". To be added, one day...
-MAC OS X console error message as per below. solution is moving objects to sharedContext, task created above in MISSING section.
	AL lib: (EE) alc_cleanup: 1 device not closed
	Assertion failed: (lockret == althrd_success), function LockLists, file /Users/m/Desktop/tmp/openal/build_deps/openal-soft-openal-soft-1.17.2/Alc/ALc.c, line 776.
	Abort trap: 6
	---
	That's you issue, global initialized SFML resources. As such the destruction order of these global objects is undefined 
	So SFML's global AL device can be destroyed before the Ball object gets destroyed, which leads to an error
	The dirty fix would be to manually destroy all the objects before the application is terminated
	One of the issues with using a global unique_ptr is that, even when you intialize it in a scoped matter, the destruction will still not be defined (I think), 
	since the unique_ptr lives on until the end of scope, i.e. the end of application
-Workaround for the above issue: On quit instruction, if the O/S is Mac, send "system command `killall snake`, if O/S is *not* Mac,  then, do a normal exit

// ENHANCEMENT -----------------------------------------------------------------
-Allow window to be resized (auto-scale). currently, if resized screen ratios get messed up
-Remove white-block fruit and switch to single-white-digit-text as the fruit - just like original game.
-Move (currently global unique_ptr) game objects to a sharedContext struct
-Align sounds with:	http://www.tripletsandus.com/80s/80s_games/shockwave_snake.htm	'game over', 'ate fruit'
-Centralize font resources & load only once!

// FIXED / COMPLETED / DONE / CANCELLED ----------------------------------------
